    "section": "",
    "text": "Cam Newton and Tim Tebow were arguably two of the most electrifying and impactful players in college football history. Auburn and Florida were elevated to new heights and the two players were etched into football history with their Heisman seasons. Cam Newton’s in 2010 and Tim Tebow’s in 2007. Means both of these magical seasons were 14 and 17 years ago respectively, it is worth taking a look back at these seasons when compared to other Heisman winners around the same time Troy Smith of Ohio State in 2006, Jameis Winston of Florida State in 2013, and Robert Griffin III of Baylor in 2011, and seeing what made Newton and Tebow’s seasons so special.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary (waffle)\n\nQBstats2010 &lt;- read_csv(\"2010.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nQBstats2007 &lt;- read_csv(\"2007.csv\") |&gt;\n   mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nStatscomp &lt;- read_csv(\"tebow-newton-stats.csv\") \n\nnewtonisarunningback &lt;- read_csv(\"2010runningback.csv\") |&gt;\n   mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nplayersheismanstats &lt;- read_csv(\"heisman stats.csv\") |&gt;\n   mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nseasonrankings &lt;- read_csv (\"team ranking data.csv\")\n\nTeamstats &lt;- read_csv (\"teamstats.csv\") \n\nwaffle2 &lt;- read_csv (\"waffle2.csv\") \n\ntable &lt;- read_csv (\"tabledata.csv\") |&gt;\n   mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\n\nline &lt;- read_csv (\"w's over time.csv\") \n\ntable2 &lt;- read_csv (\"tabledata2.csv\") |&gt;\n   mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nWLine &lt;- read_csv (\"w's over time2.csv\") \n\nRushing07 &lt;- read_csv (\"2007 rushing.csv\") |&gt;\n   mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nqbrun &lt;- bind_rows (Rushing07, newtonisarunningback)\n\nfractual2010rb &lt;- read_csv(\"2010runningback.csv\") |&gt;\n   mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nfractual2007rb &lt;- read_csv(\"2007 rushing.csv\") |&gt;\n   mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\nfractualqbrush &lt;- bind_rows (fractual2010rb, fractual2007rb) |&gt;\n   mutate(Player=gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE))\n\n\n\nplayersplits &lt;- playersheismanstats |&gt; \n   select(\n     Player, RushYds, PassYds\n   ) |&gt;\n pivot_longer (\n   cols=-Player,\n   names_to=\"Type\",\n   values_to= \"Yards\")\n \n \n\n ggplot() +\n   geom_bar(data=playersplits, aes(x=reorder(Player, Yards), fill=Type, weight=Yards)) +\n   coord_flip() + \n   scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"grey\", \"blue\")) + \n   theme_minimal()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Player\", \n    y=\"Yards Rushing & Passing\", \n    title=\"How Did Tebow & Newtons Year's Compare To Other Heisman Winners?\", \n    subtitle=\"Newton & Tebow Did It Through The Air And On The Ground\", \n    caption=\"Source:College Football Reference | By: Nick Garlock\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat made Cam Newton and Tim Tebow so electrifying was the dual threat ability the likes of which had never been seen before. For most of college football history prior to Tim Tebow and Cam Newton a quarterback was either really good at throwing the football or really good at running the football, and typically if you were a runner in college you were going to be a reciever in the NFL. In college,Tebow and Newton could do both better then anyone which kept teams guessing and made them impossible to stop. Sense Cam Newton, dual threat quarterbacks have became way more common, with players such as Marcus Mariota, and Kyler Murray to name a few, that doesn’t mean they aren’t still hard to stop.\n\n\nCode\ntable2 |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Heisman QB Offensive Production\",\n    subtitle = \"Tim Tebow Was A Touchdown Machine For Florida In 2007.\"\n) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"By:Nick Garlock | **Source:** College Footall Reference\")\n  ) |&gt; \n    tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n    ) |&gt;\n  tab_style (\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color=\"blue\"),\n      cell_text(color='orange')\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body (\n      rows = Player == \"Tim Tebow\")\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeisman QB Offensive Production\n\n\nTim Tebow Was A Touchdown Machine For Florida In 2007.\n\n\nTeam\nPlayer\nPlayer TD's\nTeam Offensive TD's\nPercent The Player Accounted For\n\n\n\n\n2007 Florida\nTim Tebow\n55\n75\n73%\n\n\n2010 Auburn\nCam Newton\n50\n75\n66%\n\n\n2011 Baylor\nRobert Griffin III\n47\n80\n58%\n\n\n2006 Ohio St\nTroy Smith\n31\n55\n56%\n\n\n2013 Florida St\nJameis Winston\n44\n82\n53%\n\n\n\nBy:Nick Garlock | Source: College Footall Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother crazy thing is just how much Tebow and Newton were relied on in redzone situations. It makes sense. Lean on your best player in key situations and the results will probably be good. But no quarterbacks had ever been quite as productive and reliable in these key situations. This success in the redzone is part of what made them so electrifying.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\nFLA &lt;- c(\"OffenseYards/G\"=457.2, \"PlayerYards/G\"=321.61,42)\nAU &lt;- c(\"OffenseYards/G\"=499.2, \"PlayerYards/G\"=309.27)\n\niron(\n waffle (FLA/10,\n        rows = 10,\n        colors = c(\"blue\", \"orange\", \"white\")) +\n   labs(\n     x=\"Florida 1 square = 12 yards\",\n     title=\"Amount of Total Offense Accounted For\",\n     subtitle=\"Newton And Tebow Put Their Teams On Their Backs\") +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\n waffle(AU/10,\n        rows = 10,\n        colors = c(\"navy\", \"orange\")) +\n    labs(\n     x = \"Auburn 1 square = 9 yards\",\n     caption=\"Source: College Football Reference | Graphic by Nick Garlock\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarterbacks typically have to put their teams on their backs and are the key to making things go. Tim Tebow and Cam Newton both accounted for well over half of their teams offensive yards with Tebow accounting for a greater portion. It is worth noting that Florida for all of Tebow’s college career had significantly better players then Auburn ever did. Tebow could throw to players like Percy Harvin and Aaron Hernandez so he could rack up a greater share of yards whereas Cam Newton never had such weapons. Auburn did have an all around better rushing attack and more total offensive yards and because of this, Cam Newton had a smaller share of the yards.\n\n\nCode\nqb &lt;- qbrun |&gt; filter(RushYds &gt; 500 & RushTDs &gt; 5 & RushAtt &gt; 75)\n\nPlayer &lt;- qb |&gt; filter (Player == \"Tim Tebow\" | Player ==\"Cam Newton\")\n  \nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=qb, \n    aes(x=RushYds, y=RushAtt, size=RushTDs),\ncolor=\"grey\",\nalpha=.5) +\n    geom_point(\n      data=Player,\n      aes(RushYds, y=RushAtt, size=RushTDs), color=\"blue\"\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Cam Newton & Tim Tebow Get In The Endzone\",\n    x = \"Rush Yards\",\n    y = \"Rush Attempts\",\n    size = \"Touchdowns\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.863151) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.448228) +\ngeom_text_repel(\n    data=Player, \n    aes(x=RushYds, y=RushAtt, label=Player)\n  ) +\n  labs(title=\"Cam Newton & Tim Tebow Could Have Been Running Backs\", subtitle=\"Tim Tebow & Cam Newton Were As Reliable As Any In Redzone Situations\", caption=\"Source: College Football Reference | By Nick Garlock\")  + theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo further illustrate the dual threat ability we look at all rushing stats from the 2007 and 2010 season with an extra emphaisis on touchdowns. Cam Newton ran for 20 touchdowns and 1,400 yards in 2010 and Tim Tebow ran for 23 touchdowns and around 900 yards. Both these stat lines would be considered solid seasons for runningbacks. Cam Newton would have been the 12th best runningback in the country in 2010 if you just looked at yards, but he also avereaged 5.6 yards a carry which would also put him up there. Tim Tebow in 2007 had over 200 carries for a 4.3 average. Not quite as glamorous for a running back but still really good. Tim Tebow could have and in some ways was an extremely reliable 3rd down back for Florida."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ah, Jameis Winston. Mr Crablegs. Mr. Eating W’s. And the first overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He spent 5 seasons as their starting quarterback before getting replaced by… Tom Brady? Oh, yeah. Well that makes sense. He was average to above average statistically. Never standing out particularly brightly in any particular area. Except for one season. His last season as an NFL starting QB to date. The 2019 season. Jameis Winston’s stats from 2019 are absolutely crazy. They make no sense, Jameis Winston in 2019 threw for an NFL leading 5,109 yards but also threw 30 interceptions but somehow then also threw for 33 touchdowns. Every single thing about this season for the 2019 Tampa Bay Buccaners defied odds because of one man.

He was so good yet so bad at the same time. The season stands out in all of NFL history but especially when compared to all Qb’s sense 2015. Yes, there is a gradual correlation between more yards and more interceptions, but those on the graph with highest interception totals still were not super close in yards or turnovers.\n\n\nCode\nreducedpassing &lt;-passing |&gt;\n  filter( Int &gt; 20) |&gt;\n  separate(QBrec, into=c(\"Wins\", \"Loses\", \"Ties\"), sep=\"-\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Wins = as.numeric(Wins))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=reducedpassing, \n    aes(y=reorder(PlayerSeason, Int), x=Int, xend=Wins),\n    size = 2,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"darkgreen\") + \n  labs(x=\"Wins vs Interceptions\", y=\"\", title=\"Wins For Players With Over 20 Ints In A Season Since 2015\", subtitle=\"Jameis Winston Won More Games Despite Having Way More Interceptions\", caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Nick Garlock\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering Jameis Winston’s 30 interceptions in one season, the 7th most in NFL history. You would be justified in assuming that the 2019 Tampa Buccaneers were awful. However, they weren’t, they were very average finishing with a 7-9 record. There are only a handful of quarterbacks from 2015-2019 who threw more then 20 interceptions in a season the closest one to Jameis, Browns legend DeShone Kizer threw 22 interceptions in 2017 and those Clevland Browns won zero games. The others also threw almost ten interceptions less then Jamies and yet they all lost more. Baker Mayfield in 2019 and Phillip Rivers in 2016 were close to the Bucs win total, one game off at six but again,those two also turned the ball over far less then the Bucs did. Not mentioned on any of these charts is that Jameis also lost 12 fumbles for a total of 42 turnovers by just him, And yet again, seven games. How? However, weirder things have happened in 1962 George Blanda threw a worst in NFL history 42 interceptions and his Houston Oilers went 11-3.\n\n\nCode\n  passing20192 &lt;- passing2019 |&gt; top_n(12, wt=TD)\n  \n top12passing &lt;- passing20192 |&gt;  top_n(12, wt=TD) |&gt;\n  mutate(Difference = Int - TD) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Difference)) |&gt;\n  select(Tm, Player, TD, Int, Difference)\n\ntop12passing |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Int = \"Interceptions\",\n    TD = \"Touchdowns\", \n    Tm = \"Team\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Difference Between Touchdowns & Interceptions In 2019 For Top QBs\",\n    subtitle = \"Jameis Winston Had An Abnormally Small Difference Compared To Other QBs\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Nick Garlock  |  **Source:** [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/passing.htm)\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n   tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"grey\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Jameis Winston\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference Between Touchdowns & Interceptions In 2019 For Top QBs\n\n\nJameis Winston Had An Abnormally Small Difference Compared To Other QBs\n\n\nTeam\nPlayer\nTouchdowns\nInterceptions\nDifference\n\n\n\n\nTAM\nJameis Winston\n33\n30\n-3\n\n\nATL\nMatt Ryan\n26\n14\n-12\n\n\nSFO\nJimmy Garoppolo\n27\n13\n-14\n\n\nHOU\nDeshaun Watson\n26\n12\n-14\n\n\nDAL\nDak Prescott\n30\n11\n-19\n\n\nPHI\nCarson Wentz\n27\n7\n-20\n\n\nMIN\nKirk Cousins\n26\n6\n-20\n\n\nKAN\nPatrick Mahomes\n26\n5\n-21\n\n\nGNB\nAaron Rodgers\n26\n4\n-22\n\n\nNOR\nDrew Brees\n27\n4\n-23\n\n\nSEA\nRussell Wilson\n31\n5\n-26\n\n\nBAL\nLamar Jackson\n36\n6\n-30\n\n\n\nBy: Nick Garlock | Source: Pro Football Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarterbacks who typically throw for more touchdowns do not throw as many interceptions because if you do throw a high amount of interceptions you don’t have nearly as many opportunities to throw touchdowns because the ball is at the hands of the opponent.
