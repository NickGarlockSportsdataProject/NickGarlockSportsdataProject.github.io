    "text": "Ah, Jameis Winston. Mr Crablegs. Mr. Eating W’s. And the first overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He spent 5 seasons as their starting quarterback before getting replaced by… (checks notes) Tom Brady? Oh, yeah. Well that makes sense. He was average to above average statistically. Never standing out particularly brightly in any particular area. Except for one season. His last season as an NFL starting QB to date. The 2019 season. Jameis Winston’s stats from 2019 are absolutely crazy. They make no. Sense. Jameis Winston in 2019 threw for an NFL leading 5,109 yards but also threw 30 interceptions but somehow then also threw for 33 touchdowns. Every single thing about this season for the 2019 Tampa Bay Buccaners defies odds because of one man. Mr Jameis Winston.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\npassing2015 &lt;- read_csv(\"2015passing.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2015, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing2016 &lt;- read_csv(\"2016passing.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing2017 &lt;- read_csv(\"2017passing.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"2018passing.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing2019 &lt;-read_csv(\"2019passing.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019, PlayerSeason = paste(Player,Season)) |&gt; mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\",Player)) |&gt;\n   mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\",Player)) |&gt;\n   mutate(PlayerSeason=gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\",PlayerSeason)) |&gt;\n   mutate(PlayerSeason=gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\",PlayerSeason))\n\npassing2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"2020passing.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing2021 &lt;- read_csv(\"2021passing.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021, PlayerSeason = paste(Player,Season))\n\npassing2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"2022passing.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022, PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season))\n\npassing2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"2023passing.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023, PlayerSeason = paste (Player, Season))\n\npassing &lt;- bind_rows(passing2015, passing2016, passing2017, passing2018, passing2019, passing2020, passing2021, passing2022, passing2023) \n\npassing &lt;- passing |&gt; mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\",Player)) |&gt;\n   mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\",Player)) |&gt;\n   mutate(PlayerSeason=gsub(\"\\\\*\",\"\",PlayerSeason)) |&gt;\n   mutate(PlayerSeason=gsub(\"\\\\+\",\"\",PlayerSeason))\n\npassing4 &lt;- passing |&gt;\n  filter(\n  Att &gt; 100 &\n  G &gt; 5\n  )\n\njw &lt;- passing4 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Jameis Winston\")\n\njw2019 &lt;- jw |&gt; filter (Season == \"2019\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data = passing4, aes(x=Yds...12, y=`Int`), color=\"black\") + \ngeom_smooth(data = passing4, aes(x=Yds...12, y=`Int`), method=lm, se=FALSE) + \n  geom_point(data=jw2019, aes(x=`Yds...12`, y=`Int`), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=jw2019, aes(x=`Yds...12`, y=`Int`,label= PlayerSeason)) +\n  labs(x=\"Season Passing Yards\", y=\"Interceptions Per Season\", title=\"QB Yards and Interceptions From 2015-2023\", subtitle=\"Jameis Winston's 2019 Season Is A Statistical Oddity.\", caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Nick Garlock\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate this oddity the data displayed will follow a period from 2015-2019 as interesting as that would be to look at all of NFL history, it would make for way too many datapoints. He was so good yet so bad at the same time. The season stands out in all of NFL history but especially when comapred to all Qb’s sense 2015. Most of the quarterback that has passed for over 4,500 yards in a season are also on the lower to average end on interceptions. Players like Tom Brady or Drew Brees. Hardly anybody during that time period was very high up in that upper right quadrant. Jameis Winston lies all alone.\n\n\nCode\nreducedpassing &lt;-passing |&gt;\n  filter( Int &gt; 20) |&gt;\n  separate(QBrec, into=c(\"Wins\", \"Loses\", \"Ties\"), sep=\"-\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Wins = as.numeric(Wins))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=reducedpassing, \n    aes(y=reorder(PlayerSeason, Int), x=Int, xend=Wins),\n    size = 2,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"darkgreen\") + \n  labs(x=\"Wins vs Interceptions\", y=\"\", title=\"Wins For Players With Over 20 Ints In A Season Since 2015\", subtitle=\"Jameis Winston Won More Games Despite Having Way More Interceptions\", caption=\"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Nick Garlock\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen considering Jameis Winston’s 30 interceptions in one season, the 7th most in NFL history. You would be justified in assuming that the 2019 Tampa Buccaneers were awful. However, they weren’t, they were very average finishing with a 7-9 record. There are only a handful of quarterbacks from 2015-2019 who threw more then 20 interceptions in a season the closest one to Jameis, Browns legend DeShone Kizer threw 22 interceptions in 2017 and those Clevland Browns won zero games. The others also threw almost ten interceptions less then Jamies and yet they all lost more. Baker Mayfield in 2019 and Phillip Rivers in 2016 were close to the Bucs win total, one game off at six but again, also those two also turned the ball over far less then the Bucs did. Not mentioned on any of these charts is that Jameis also lost 12 fumbles for a total of 42 turnovers by just him, And yet again, seven games. How? However, weirder things have happened in 1960 George Blanda threw a worst in NFL history 42 interceptions and his Houston Oilers went 11-3.\n\n\nCode\n  passing20192 &lt;- passing2019 |&gt; top_n(12, wt=TD)\n  \n top12passing &lt;- passing20192 |&gt;  top_n(12, wt=TD) |&gt;\n  mutate(Difference = Int - TD) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Difference)) |&gt;\n  select(Tm, Player, TD, Int, Difference)\n\ntop12passing |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Int = \"Interceptions\",\n    TD = \"Touchdowns\", \n    Tm = \"Team\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Difference Between Touchdowns & Interceptions In 2019 For Top QBs\",\n    subtitle = \"Jameis Winston Had An Abnormally Small Difference Compared To Other QBs\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Nick Garlock  |  **Source:** [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2019/passing.htm)\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n  ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n   tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"grey\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Player == \"Jameis Winston\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference Between Touchdowns & Interceptions In 2019 For Top QBs\n\n\nJameis Winston Had An Abnormally Small Difference Compared To Other QBs\n\n\nTeam\nPlayer\nTouchdowns\nInterceptions\nDifference\n\n\n\n\nTAM\nJameis Winston\n33\n30\n-3\n\n\nATL\nMatt Ryan\n26\n14\n-12\n\n\nSFO\nJimmy Garoppolo\n27\n13\n-14\n\n\nHOU\nDeshaun Watson\n26\n12\n-14\n\n\nDAL\nDak Prescott\n30\n11\n-19\n\n\nPHI\nCarson Wentz\n27\n7\n-20\n\n\nMIN\nKirk Cousins\n26\n6\n-20\n\n\nKAN\nPatrick Mahomes\n26\n5\n-21\n\n\nGNB\nAaron Rodgers\n26\n4\n-22\n\n\nNOR\nDrew Brees\n27\n4\n-23\n\n\nSEA\nRussell Wilson\n31\n5\n-26\n\n\nBAL\nLamar Jackson\n36\n6\n-30\n\n\n\nBy: Nick Garlock | Source: Pro Football Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing along with the scatterplot from earlier. quarterbacks with over 4,500 pass yards usually were around leauge average to less then average on the amount of interceptions they threw. Higher yards and higher interceptions do not correlate because if you are turning the ball over a ton you theroretically would not have a chance to get as many yards. Similarly, quarterbacks who typically throw for more touchdowns do not throw as many interceptions because if you do throw a high amount of interceptions you don’t have nearly as many opportunities to throw touchdowns. Yet again, Jamies defied this logic. He threw only three more touchdowns then he did interceptions. The next closest difference is Matt Ryan who threw for 26 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 2019. A difference of 12."
